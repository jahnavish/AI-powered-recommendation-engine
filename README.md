# AI Powered Recommendation Engine
This is an ***AI-powered recommendation engine*** for an e-commerce platform that provides personalized product recommendations to users. The recommendation engine leverages multiple strategies to deliver personalized and relevant product suggestions:

1. **Content-Based Filtering:** This approach recommends products similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on product features and descriptions. It analyzes the attributes of products to provide tailored recommendations.

2. **Popularity-Based Recommendations:** This method suggests products based on their popularity, considering metrics like the number of ratings and average ratings. It addresses cold-start problems by promoting well-regarded items to new users.

3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combining content-based and popularity-based methods, this strategy integrates both techniques to offer a comprehensive recommendation system. It balances personalization with broad appeal, enhancing the overall recommendation quality.

The engineâ€™s performance is evaluated using a controlled random sampling strategy to ensure accurate and representative results.

In this recommendation engine, I have used the **'Amazon Products Sales Dataset 2023'** dataset from **Kaggle**, specifically the **'All Appliances.csv'** which has 8K+ All Appliances Product's Details.

### The dataset for this recommender system can be downloaded from here:

[All Appliances.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset/data?select=All+Appliances.csv) 

## To deploy this model and run it locally:

1. Clone the model (Run it in terminal or command prompt)

`git clone https://github.com/jahnavish/AI-powered-recommendation-engine.git`

2. Clone the model directly in Jupyter:

Open a Jupyter Notebook on your local machine

Run shell commands by adding ! as the prefix before your command

`!git clone https://github.com/jahnavish/AI-powered-recommendation-engine.git`

This will clone the repository directly in your Jupyter.
